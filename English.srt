1
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,609
<i>Many strange tales
are told of this jungle.</i>

2
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,649
<i>But none so strange...</i>

3
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,083
<i>As the tale of the cub we call mowgli.</i>

4
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,886
You must be the very
worst wolf I've ever seen.

5
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,324
Yeah, but if that branch didn't break,
i would've made it.

6
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,326
Crossing upwind,
breaking from your numbers.

7
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,881
If you can't learn to run with the pack...

8
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,485
One of these days,
you'll be someone's dinner.

9
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,846
- How'd we do?
- Not mowgli, again.

10
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,526
- He's never gonna make the council.
- Let's go!

11
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,404
Race you to the top!

12
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,764
It was higher ground.

13
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,082
Wolves don't hide in trees.

14
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,401
I can't keep up with them, bagheera.

15
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,604
I tried. I just picked the wrong tree.

16
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,091
It was a dead tree.

17
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,608
How was I supposed to know
it was dead?

18
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,886
It had a fig vine.

19
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,965
Any tree girdled by a creeper
is either dead or close to it.

20
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,169
- These are things a wolf must know.
- Yeah.

21
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,404
But if the branch didn't break,
i would've made it.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,241
I realise you weren't born a wolf...

23
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,289
But couldn't you at least act like one?

24
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,930
<i>Bagheera'. When I found him...</i>

25
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,650
Many <i>years</i> ago...

26
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,642
<i>He was just an infant,
abandoned in the woods.</i>

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,290
Get the deer!

28
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,602
<i>If he
was going to survive...</i>

29
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,288
<i>I knew he needed a people.</i>

30
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,244
<i>A people to protect him.</i>

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,204
<i>That's why I entrusted him
to the wolves.</i>

32
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,284
Look well, wolves.

33
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,009
<i>Akela was
a just and noble leader.</i>

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,530
<i>He allowed mowgli to dwell
among them, all those years.</i>

35
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,642
<i>The trouble was, wolves grew so fast...</i>

36
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,366
<i>And mowgli...</i>

37
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,171
<i>Let's just say he liked to take his time.</i>

38
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,481
Mowgli, pick me up high!

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,202
- My turn!
- Stop. Not now.

40
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,522
<i>It was raksha
who raised him.</i>

41
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,722
<i>She was the only mother he ever knew.</i>

42
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,766
- Come on, let's play!
- I don't feel like playing, gray.

43
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,968
Come on, you're my brother.
You have to play with me.

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,009
Let's go chase some mice.

45
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,970
How did it go?

46
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,130
Caught me again.

47
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,809
If it's meant to be...

48
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,883
It will be.

49
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,210
Let me hear the law.

50
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,604
"This is the law of the jungle...

51
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,331
"As old and as true as the sky.

52
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,922
"The wolf that keeps it will prosper...

53
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,845
"But the wolf that breaks it will die.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,526
"Like the creeper that girdles
the tree trunk...

55
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,041
"The law runneth over and back.

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,771
"For the strength of the pack
is the wolf...

57
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,367
"And the strength of the wolf
is the pack."

58
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,922
<i>Soon,
the rain ceased to fall</i>

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,889
<i>and the dry season arrived.</i>

60
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,288
<i>Heat crept through the jungle...</i>

61
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,851
<i>Turning it yellow...</i>

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,240
<i>Then brown...</i>

63
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,811
<i>Then black.</i>

64
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,690
<i>But that year...</i>

65
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,844
<i>Was the driest season
that anyone could remember.</i>

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,162
<i>Even the mohwa didn't flower.</i>

67
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,086
My leaf.

68
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,643
This is mine. Mine, mine, mine.

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,246
There's a rock. That's mud. That's mud.

70
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,890
There's a rock. That's my rock.

71
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,690
That's my rock.
Nobody touches my rock.

72
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,281
There's another rock.
Two rocks. Three rocks.

73
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,283
Peace rock? Peace rock!

74
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,921
It's the truce! The water truce!

75
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,127
It's the water truce!

76
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,084
<i>It had been
many, many years</i>

77
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,162
<i>since the peace rock was revealed...</i>

78
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,161
<i>And the water truce was called.</i>

79
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,721
<i>Hunting at the riverbank</i>

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,801
<i>- was now forbidden...</i>

81
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,646
<i>Because, by law of the jungle,
drinking comes before eating.</i>

82
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,883
<i>So, you could come to the peace rock,
on a day like this...</i>

83
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,163
<i>And find all people side-by-side.</i>

84
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,801
Don't forget.

85
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,927
No hunting.

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,001
Playing ony-

87
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,610
playing, only. I got it, ami.

88
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,081
And remember...

89
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,806
Not everyone here has seen
a man-cub in the jungle before.

90
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,371
So, behave yourself.

91
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,404
Okay, can I go now?

92
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,766
Take the pups with you.

93
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,891
Wait for me!

94
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,601
Come on, gray!

95
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,961
Oh, take a look at this guy.

96
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,921
Excuse me.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,764
Sorry.

98
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,088
- He's walking on two legs.
- Don't stare.

99
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,480
Hey, look. A wild boar.

100
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,041
- And a rhino.
- And a mongoose.

101
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,201
Everybody's here.

102
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,644
Ls that a peacock?

103
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,885
- Ooh, a stick!
-Lkkl: Oh, that's my stick.

104
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,485
- I like this stick.
- Seriously, that's my stick.

105
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,727
- This is my stick.
- No, that's my stick!

106
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,370
- Let go of my stick!
-Lt's a water truce!

107
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,727
It's a water truce!

108
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,887
Sorry.

109
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,482
My bad! It's involuntary.

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,606
Lkkl: I could pee on it.

111
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,285
Watch yourself, please.

112
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,084
Dad, what is that?

113
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,890
I think that's a man-cub.

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,042
What's a man-cub doing here?

115
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,244
Whoa. Don't forget the truce.

116
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,050
I know the law, bucks.

117
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,451
What is that?

118
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,925
- Weird.
- That's weird.

119
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,441
Akelai mowgli.

120
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,447
What was the rule about your tricks?

121
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,602
It's not the wolf way.

122
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,444
No more tricks.

123
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,285
Chin up, little one.

124
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,010
We'll make you a fine wolf, yet.

125
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,124
What about me?
Am I gonna be a fine wolf?

126
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,406
Look at me howl!

127
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,723
In some packs, the runt gets eaten.

128
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,121
Oh...

129
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,125
Mowgli, behind me.

130
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,564
Don't leave my side.

131
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,243
Everyone comes to peace rock.
So many smells to catch up on.

132
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,606
But, um...

133
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,530
I can't help but notice...

134
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,203
There's this strange odour today.

135
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,727
What is it, this scent that I'm on?

136
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,280
I almost...

137
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,560
I almost think it was some kind of...

138
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,441
Man-cub.

139
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,089
Mowgli belongs
to my pack, shere Khan.

140
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,561
Mowgli?

141
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,322
They've given it a name.

142
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,882
When was it we came to adopt
man into the jungle?

143
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,890
He's just a cub.

144
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,365
Does my face not remind you
of what a grown man can do?

145
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,410
Shift your hunting ground
for a few years...

146
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,450
And everyone forgets
how the law works.

147
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,686
Well, let me remind you.

148
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,442
A man-cub becomes man...

149
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,440
And man is forbidden!

150
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,607
- What do you know about law?
- Raksha.

151
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,206
Hunting for pleasure. Killing for power.

152
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,921
You've never known law.
The cub is mine!

153
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,641
Mine to me.

154
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,888
So, go back to where you came from,
you burned beast!

155
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,763
The tiger knows who rules
this part of the jungle.

156
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,766
I'm sure he doesn't mean to come here
and make threats.

157
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,490
Especially during a water truce.

158
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,969
No, I'm deeply respectful of these laws
that keep us safe.

159
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,529
So, here's my promise.

160
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,169
Nothing lasts forever.

161
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,285
The rains will return
and the river will rise.

162
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,162
And when this rock disappears,
that truce will end.

163
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,166
You want to protect him, fine.

164
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,204
But ask yourselves,
how many lives is a man-cub worth?

165
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,529
<i>Bagheera". How many lives?</i>

166
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,842
<i>Who could answer that question?</i>

167
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,208
- The rain!
- Rain!

168
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,361
- Rain!
- The rain!

169
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,411
Keep it dry, keep it dry, keep it dry.

170
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,327
These quills
get stuck on everything!

171
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,883
<i>Bagheera". When the rains returned...</i>

172
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,400
<i>It was a question
the council had to face.</i>

173
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,771
<i>They deliberated and they argued...</i>

174
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,604
<i>For many days.</i>

175
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,882
What do you think they're talking about?

176
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,764
<i>No one had ever
come between the pack before.</i>

177
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,441
<i>But shere Khan's threat...</i>

178
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,602
<i>Was not to be ignored.</i>

179
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,411
Mowgli, you're not supposed
to go up there!

180
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,291
He's got to go.

181
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,001
Look at the skies.

182
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,281
Shere Khan may be heading here
as we speak.

183
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,044
Please!

184
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,570
I'm leaving.

185
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,370
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

186
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,524
Mowgli, go back to the den!

187
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,331
A man-cub belongs with man.

188
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,290
We raised him as one of our own!

189
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,126
- He'll have the boy, either way.
- Akela.

190
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,970
Maybe I can be of help.

191
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,485
The boy's right.

192
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,529
Maybe it's time he found another people.

193
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,367
- No.
-L'm the one who brought him to you.

194
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,648
And now I'll return him
to where he belongs.

195
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,126
I won't let you.

196
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,681
He's my cub!

197
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,161
We knew this day would come.

198
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,608
We are the only family he's ever known!

199
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,841
Raksha.

200
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,211
It's the only place he'll be safe.

201
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,126
It's okay, ami.

202
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,845
I won't go far.

203
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,682
I'll come back and visit.

204
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,442
Never forget this...

205
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,203
You're mine.

206
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,885
Mine to me.

207
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,161
No matter where you go,
or what they may call you...

208
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,731
You will always be...

209
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,440
My son.

210
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,890
<i>I wish I could tell you...</i>

211
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,566
<i>That the wolves
could've fought shere Khan.</i>

212
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,562
<i>But this is not that kind of a tale.</i>

213
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,769
The turtles like me.

214
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,763
Maybe the crocodiles.

215
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,366
What about the rhinos?

216
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,403
They always let me hang around.

217
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,728
Of course, the rhinos sleep standing up.

218
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,249
I don't think I'd be very good at that.

219
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,727
It's either the turtles or the crocodiles.

220
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,605
Which one do you think is better?

221
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,000
Bagheerai neither.

222
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,850
What do you mean?

223
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,241
I'm bringing you to the man village.

224
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,601
What?

225
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,567
Bagheera, I don't know man.

226
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,846
You will.

227
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,450
You always said
we're not supposed

228
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,608
to go near a man village.

229
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,609
That was different.

230
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,370
Why is it different?

231
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,404
You always said, "stay away
from the man village...

232
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,085
"Because you might fall in a trap...

233
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,767
"Or get eaten,
or get hurt by flying rocks."

234
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,604
I know what I said.

235
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,724
Whoa. Elephants.

236
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,322
- Bow your head.
- Why?

237
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,482
Show them respect.

238
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,440
The elephants
created this jungle.

239
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,648
Where they made furrows
with their tusks,

240
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,006
the rivers ran.

241
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,889
Where they blew with
their trunks, the leaves fell.

242
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,321
They made all that belongs.

243
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,481
The mountains, the trees...

244
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,803
The birds in the trees.

245
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,485
But they did not make you.

246
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,249
That is why you must go.

247
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,046
What if I live with the nilgai?

248
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,121
No.

249
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,806
Or the mongoose?

250
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,525
This is not a discussion.

251
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,011
But this is my home!

252
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,525
I don't even know what man's like.

253
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,966
You'll learn.

254
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,360
But I wanna stay in the jungle.

255
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,086
Why do I have to go there?

256
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,402
Because the jungle
is no longer safe for you.

257
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,607
You're being hunted...

258
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,047
<i>B'! 8 “get.</i>

259
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,089
Only man can protect you now.

260
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,161
Whoa!

261
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,211
This isn't fair.
You're not giving me a choice.

262
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,970
There's a lot of stuff
you're not telling me, too.

263
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,645
Don't think I didn't notice.

264
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,529
You say you're taking me
where I came from...

265
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,125
But you found me in the jungle.

266
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,687
Are you bringing me back
to the jungle? No.

267
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,251
Why are you bringing me
to the man village

268
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,640
if you found me in the jungle?

269
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,723
And why does the tiger
hate me so much?

270
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,803
Does he know me?
Sure seems like he knows me.

271
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,967
Down.

272
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,810
What? Now we have to bow
to the buffalo, too?

273
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,889
Listen to me. This is not a game.

274
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,929
You're gonna run to that ravine.

275
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,930
What are you talking about?

276
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,850
Go to the north,
where the sky glows at night.

277
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,001
I'll find you on that path.

278
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,368
Bagheera, I'm not taking one
more step until you tell me...

279
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,125
Bagheerai run, mowgli!

280
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,961
Run!

281
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,245
Gray, what's wrong?

282
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,368
Why don't you come outside and play?

283
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,121
What is that?

284
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,090
Why did he have to leave?

285
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,287
Gray.

286
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,331
We could've protected him.
We shouldn't have let him go.

287
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,251
I miss him, too.

288
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,371
What's important is, he's safe now.

289
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,770
Get inside.

290
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,965
I suppose you know why I've come.

291
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,928
The man-cub has left the jungle.

292
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,204
I thought I made myself clear.

293
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,562
I wanted him turned over to me.

294
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,483
We no longer harbour him.

295
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,321
He has left the pack.

296
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,010
And where, may I ask, has he gone?

297
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,524
He's with his own kind now.

298
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,087
So, the man-cub has left the jungle.

299
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,166
Akelai that's right.

300
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,927
You and I no longer have a quarrel.

301
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,003
And, most importantly...

302
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,491
We have peace.

303
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,082
I guess it's done, then.

304
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,409
Unless I can draw him...

305
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,887
Back out!

306
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,845
Akela!

307
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,049
Have I got your attention now?

308
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,000
I didn't want it to be this way.

309
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,362
I made it so simple.

310
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,161
All I asked for was one thing,
and you denied me!

311
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,162
That ends now.

312
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,210
Spread the word.

313
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,127
Until I have the man-cub,
these hills are my hills.

314
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,726
You did not respond to reason!

315
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,929
So now, you will know fear.

316
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,370
Bagheera?

317
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,001
Hmm?

318
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,245
Hey, there.

319
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,371
Do you have a language?

320
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,368
You're kind of cute, I guess.

321
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,525
You want a bite?

322
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,441
Come on.

323
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,167
Come here. Come on, it's all right.

324
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,651
Don't be afraid.

325
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,685
Come on.

326
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,369
Hey, those are mine!

327
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,406
Hey, come back!

328
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,204
Those are mine!

329
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,486
Drop it!

330
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,410
Hello?

331
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,450
Who's out there?

332
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,729
Kaai hi, little cub.

333
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,802
Oh, no. Don't be scared.

334
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,769
I'm not gonna hurt you.

335
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,925
I was just passing through.
I don't want any trouble.

336
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,082
There's no trouble.

337
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,969
Are you alone out here?

338
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,603
Mmm. That's not good.

339
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,440
We should never be alone.

340
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,442
I'm waiting for a friend.

341
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,443
He should be here soon.

342
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,968
I can stay with you,
until he gets here.

343
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,288
Would that be all right?

344
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,442
I'll keep you safe.

345
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,450
Just you and me, sweet thing.

346
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,085
Who are you?

347
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,047
Kaa.

348
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,241
Poor, sweet little cub.

349
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,203
What are you doing
so deep in the jungle?

350
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,324
This is my home.

351
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,530
Don't you know what you are?

352
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,962
I know what you are.

353
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,847
I know where you came from.

354
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,450
You do?

355
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,491
Yes.

356
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,491
Would you like to see?

357
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,006
Yeah.

358
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,531
<i>Kaa". Mostly, men stay in their village...</i>

359
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,200
<i>Far from the dark of the jungle.</i>

360
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,045
<i>But sometimes...</i>

361
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,725
<i>They travel.</i>

362
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,848
<i>And when they</i> do...

363
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,004
<i>Their caves breathe in the dark.</i>

364
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,690
<i>They call it...</i>

365
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,531
<i>The red flower.</i>

366
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,404
<i>Man's creation.</i>

367
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,528
<i>It brings warmth and light...</i>

368
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,045
<i>And destruction to all that it touches.</i>

369
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,731
<i>Who is that?</i>

370
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,963
<i>The traveller, protecting his cub.</i>

371
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,840
<i>Shere Khan ended
the man's life that night.</i>

372
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,245
<i>But not before he was burned
by the red flower's touch.</i>

373
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,084
<i>He ran so fast, he didn't
notice the cub he left behind.</i>

374
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,163
<i>And that cub...</i>

375
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,446
<i>Was you.</i>

376
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,128
<i>The panther found you.</i>

377
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,809
Oh, you poor, sweet thing.

378
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,282
You want to stay in the jungle?

379
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,481
You can be with me, if you want.

380
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,648
I'll keep you close.

381
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,487
Let go of your fear, now.

382
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,561
Trust...

383
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,171
In me.

384
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,721
Relax, kid.

385
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,206
No need to get worked up. Okay?

386
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,330
- Where am I?
- Uh...

387
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,522
This is a cave. It's my cave.

388
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,170
You don't remember
what happened, do you?

389
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,563
- No.
- I saved your life.

390
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,608
Yeah, I snatched you
from the jaws of death.

391
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,922
The coils of death, if you will.

392
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,969
And lucky for you...

393
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,243
Your new favourite hero,
old baloo, here...

394
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,721
Just happened to be passing by.

395
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,881
Uh, no big deal.

396
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,208
Just tell me this.

397
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,926
Can you...

398
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,571
Climb?

399
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,481
Yeah.

400
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,730
Then let's quit wasting time
and get on with it.

401
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,406
Get on with what?

402
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,922
Payback, kid. Payback.

403
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,051
What do you mean "payback"?
Payback for what?

404
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,240
You owe me, kid.

405
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,129
You owe me. You owe me.

406
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,281
Slow down.

407
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,209
- And you're gonna pay back.
- But, but...

408
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,486
Because that's right.

409
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,806
You're gonna do the right thing.

410
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,961
That's the right thing to do.

411
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,485
You're gonna pay me back,
because you owe me.

412
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,721
You got it?

413
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,451
Okay, here's our little task.

414
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,602
You see that golden stuff,
dripping down there?

415
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,411
That's called "honey."

416
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,444
All you need to do, little one...

417
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,090
For payback purposes...

418
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,607
Is to just shimmy on up there...

419
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,331
And get me that thing up there
that's making that funny noise...

420
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,005
And bring it back down.

421
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,884
You're kidding me, right?

422
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,404
No, not really.

423
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,088
I can get killed
going up there.

424
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,480
Kid!

425
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,088
Kid, kid, kid. Try to understand this.

426
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,761
I'm a bear.

427
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,491
It means that I have to eat my weight...

428
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,687
Every day...

429
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,490
For hibernation purposes.

430
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,207
I know I'm asking for a lot...

431
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,408
But I don't climb and you do.

432
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,124
Look, I really need your help.
Winter's coming.

433
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,282
You don't want me to go to sleep...

434
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,283
And never wake up.

435
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,082
There are a lot of bees up here.

436
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,925
Yeah, some.

437
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,367
But don't worry. These ones don't sting.

438
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,121
Attaboy!

439
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,405
Ow! I'm getting stung!

440
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,724
Okay-

441
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,647
I would've done this myself,
but I'm afraid of heights.

442
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,286
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

443
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,761
Why don't you mind your own business?

444
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,081
You can do it!

445
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,248
- He's just gonna run away.
- Not this one.

446
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,165
As soon as the monkeys get
stung, they always run away.

447
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,409
- He's not a monkey. A man-cub.
- What is he?

448
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,689
A man-cub?
Yeah! Could you keep your voice down?

449
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,041
I'm trying to concentrate.

450
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,364
- Everything going a-okay up there?
- Ow!

451
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,923
Oh, boy. Looks like you got another one.

452
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,441
- Buzz off.
-Lt's a man-cub.

453
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,967
- A man-cub?
- Yeah, it's a man-cub.

454
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,407
- It's not a monkey?
- No, it's a man-cub!

455
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,447
You have never been
a more endangered species...

456
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,130
Than you are at this moment.

457
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,528
You're doing an amazing job!

458
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,131
I'm getting stung!

459
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,926
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

460
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,809
-It's not a monkey, Fred.
-Lt's a man-cub.

461
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,325
- A man-cub?
- Yeah, it's a man-cub.

462
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,050
- Can you believe it?
- Are you sure?

463
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,766
Would you please shut up?

464
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,326
He)', up there!

465
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,642
Everything is
going fantastically, I see.

466
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,801
Ow!

467
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,888
You got it!
Believe in yourself!

468
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,283
-There you go!
- Ow!

469
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,966
Come on! Almost!

470
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,841
Yeah!

471
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,321
Yeah!

472
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,841
Oh. Yeah!

473
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,690
Uh-oh.

474
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,806
Fred?

475
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,002
Oh, yeah, exfoliate me.

476
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,280
You said they didn't sting.

477
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,329
What do you call this?

478
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,444
How the heck did you do that?

479
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,682
Oh, those must have been females!

480
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,810
They look like males
from down here.

481
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,725
Females do sting.

482
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,769
Just put some honey on those.

483
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,208
- Honey? Really?
- Yeah.

484
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,449
You put it on, you lick it off.
You feel much better.

485
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,689
It's nature's ointment.

486
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,365
I put it everywhere.

487
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,161
Thanks.

488
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,566
Okay, so, we're even now!

489
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,166
Hold on a minute.

490
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,801
What's your name anyway?

491
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,803
We were never properly introduced.

492
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,883
- Mowgli.
- Mowgli?

493
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,522
Mowgli is a terrific name.

494
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,251
I bet you got that one
all to yourself, too.

495
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,881
Hey!

496
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,411
Mowgli, look...

497
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,086
I got a lot of gathering to do
these next couple of weeks...

498
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,648
On account of the hibernation.

499
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,604
I could really use your help.

500
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,086
You know, if you stuck around...

501
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,641
I can't. I have to go to the man village.

502
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,481
Uh...

503
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,125
For what reason, man village?

504
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,442
I don't have a choice.
There's a tiger hunting me.

505
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,244
Really? Why a tiger?

506
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,930
Because I'm a man-cub, all right?

507
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,445
Just leave me alone.

508
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,447
Hey! Mowgli, my friend,
my buddy, my pal.

509
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,125
Slow down a second, handsome.

510
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,482
Bagheera said I have to go
to the man village.

511
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,765
Oh, bagheera! I know him. Sure.

512
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,524
You know what his problem is?

513
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,842
He always plays by the rules.

514
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,008
And, sometimes rules
were meant to be...

515
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,481
Well, not necessarily broken,
but certainly bent.

516
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,041
And definitely reinterpreted.
Don't you think?

517
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,806
He told me to go to the man village,
so, that's where I'm gonna go!

518
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,927
Okay, fine.

519
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,650
You wanna go to the man village,
have it your way.

520
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,643
In fact, I'll do you one better.

521
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,689
I'll take you there myself.

522
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,683
Come on, let's go. It's getting late.

523
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,087
<i>Bare necessities</i>

524
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,161
<i>forget about</i>

525
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,201
<i>your worries and your strife</i>

526
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,842
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

527
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,365
what's that?

528
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,807
That's a song about the good life.

529
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,090
What's a song?

530
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,925
You never
heard a song before?

531
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,969
Everyone's got a song.

532
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,724
Didn't the wolves ever sing?

533
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,126
I don't know.

534
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,605
Uh... oh...

535
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,328
We recited the law of the jungle.

536
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,008
"This is the law of the jungle...

537
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,527
"As old and as true as the sky.

538
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,523
"The wolf that keeps it may prosper...

539
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,411
"But the wolf that breaks it will die."

540
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,848
Kid, that's not a song.

541
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,923
That's propaganda.

542
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,763
What's propaganda?

543
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,731
Just a little farther.

544
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,804
That's the man village?

545
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,611
Yep. You can always
tell by the red flower.

546
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,049
They do love their red flower.

547
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,126
The red flower doesn't seem so bad.

548
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,281
Yeah.

549
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,330
Let it loose, and it destroys
everything it touches.

550
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,521
Don't ever play with it.

551
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,967
You got that?

552
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,201
Yeah, I got it.

553
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,401
Good.

554
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,601
Do you think that's where I'm from?

555
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,121
Could be.

556
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,129
I don't know, kid. Does it look familiar?

557
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,561
I don't remember it.

558
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,723
All I remember is living with the wolves.

559
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,528
Why do you wanna go there?

560
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,682
Bagheera said I need a people.

561
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,681
Again, with the listening to bagheera.

562
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,490
Hey, he's my friend, okay?

563
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,201
Now I don't even know where he is.

564
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,690
I can't believe I'm leaving
the jungle for good.

565
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,251
May I say just one thing?

566
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,121
What I saw you do today,
I've never seen anything like it.

567
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,368
I've been trying to get
that honey for years.

568
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,970
But I used my tricks.

569
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,366
What tricks?

570
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,281
You know...

571
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,845
Everything that I built.
It's not the wolf way.

572
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,810
Who cares? "The wolf way."

573
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,490
That's the mowgli way.

574
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,926
That's the baloo way.

575
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,206
That's our way.

576
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,725
That's how we get things done.

577
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,843
I can't even imagine what kind
of potential you'd have...

578
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,169
If you had somebody like me
helping you out.

579
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,682
You say you want to go
to the man village.

580
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,686
I say, you could be a man right here.

581
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,001
I'll tell you what.

582
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,844
Now you know where the man village is.

583
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,321
You can always go down there,
whenever you want.

584
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,166
But I would personally appreciate it...

585
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,249
As a personal favour to me, personally...

586
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,125
If we just worked together,
just us, tricks and all.

587
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,488
I think it would be interesting to see...

588
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,802
Just how much honey
we could accumulate...

589
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,366
Before winter.

590
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,921
Whatever I could do to make
your trickiness happen...

591
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,201
<i>L will do.</i>

592
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,170
And if it turns out to
not be fun for you...

593
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,290
I will walk you right down
to that man village myself.

594
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,401
Is that a deal?

595
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,684
Just till winter.

596
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,085
Just till winter.

597
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,369
Ami, wake up.

598
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,525
Pups?

599
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,330
They're up there.

600
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,970
The deer, of course,
take comfort in numbers.

601
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,088
They lack defences
most animals will have.

602
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,527
And if we're being honest...

603
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,286
They're not very smart either.

604
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,930
Unlike the mother crocodile,

605
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,201
who is a good deal more clever.

606
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,730
But the one you have to watch out for...

607
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,406
Is the cuckoo bird.

608
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,208
Do you know
how the cuckoo bird survives?

609
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,566
By preying on a mother's weakness.

610
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,042
The cuckoo bird is too clever
to raise its young.

611
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,366
Instead, it sneaks...

612
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,485
Its eggs into the nests of simpler birds.

613
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,165
So, when they hatch...

614
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,322
The mother bird is fooled.

615
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,801
She feeds them, nurtures them.

616
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,923
And do you know what happens
to her own chicks?

617
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,285
They starve...

618
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,680
And die...

619
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,285
From neglect.

620
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,970
All because a mother loved a chick...

621
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,842
That wasn't her own.

622
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,844
Come now, time for sleep.

623
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,002
I think they like me.

624
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,529
Why are you doing this?

625
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,487
He's gone.

626
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,449
Isn't that what you wanted?

627
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,490
I want him dead.

628
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,681
Once he gets word
of what happened here...

629
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,205
He'll come back.

630
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,128
And I'll be waiting.

631
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,208
- That's the first mark.
- Got it.

632
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,045
- That's the first mark!
- Got it!

633
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,371
That's the first mark!

634
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,521
Mowglii got it!

635
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,361
Whoo!

636
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,761
Yeah, I got it!

637
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,283
- Tell him to go to the second mark!
- Got it!

638
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,243
- Go to the second mark!
- Got it.

639
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,045
Got it.

640
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,881
Look for the

641
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,650
<i>bare necessities</i>

642
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,882
<i>the simple bare necessities</i>

643
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,485
<i>forget about your worries</i>

644
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,410
<i>and your strife</i>

645
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,564
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

646
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,768
<i>old mother nature's recipes</i>

647
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,726
<i>that bring the bare
necessities of life</i>

648
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,161
<i>wherever I wander
wherever I roam</i>

649
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,641
<i>I couldn't be fonder</i>

650
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,924
<i>of my big home</i>

651
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,320
<i>the bees are buzzing</i>

652
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,761
<i>in the tree</i>

653
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,201
<i>to make some honey just for me</i>

654
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,489
<i>when you look under
the rocks and plants</i>

655
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,682
<i>and take a glance at them fancy ants</i>

656
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,605
<i>and then maybe try a few</i>

657
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,000
<i>the bare necessities of life</i>

658
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,686
<i>they'll come to you!</i>

659
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,368
Wherever! Wander

660
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,291
<i>wherever I roam</i>

661
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,920
<i>I couldn't be fonder</i>

662
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,128
<i>of my big home</i>

663
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,521
<i>the bees are buzzing in the tree</i>

664
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,126
<i>to make some honey just for me</i>

665
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,842
<i>when you look
under the rocks and plants</i>

666
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,405
<i>and then take a glance

667
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,768
<i>and then maybe try a few</i>

668
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,644
<i>mmm! Mmm!</i>

669
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,491
<i>The bare necessities of life
they'll come to you</i>

670
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,363
<i>they will come to you</i>

671
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,806
<i>yeah, they'll come to you!</i>

672
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,281
<i>Come to you!</i>

673
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,568
Baloo, baloo, baloo... look.

674
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,284
Stay low on my back.

675
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,810
Come on out and show yourself.

676
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,488
Bagheera! Ah!

677
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,081
Bagheerai mowgli.

678
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,327
Oh, I was looking everywhere for you!

679
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,640
I thought you were gone!

680
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,330
- Are you all right?
- Yeah!

681
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,927
I can't believe you found me!
I was so worried about you.

682
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,687
I was lost, and I didn't know
what happened...

683
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,080
But then I met baloo.

684
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,163
And then he saved me
from a giant snake!

685
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,930
And now we're working together!

686
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,010
Really?
That's a new wrinkle.

687
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,650
I didn't know sloth bears worked.

688
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,161
Come on, mowgli, let's be on our way.

689
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,246
Wait!

690
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,442
Yeah, go on ahead. I'll catch up.

691
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,365
Don't be mad, okay?

692
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,601
Why would I be mad?

693
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,205
Because you're always mad
when I do stuff.

694
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,442
You gotta promise
not to be mad this time.

695
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,206
Show me, then I'll decide.

696
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,045
Come on, check it out!

697
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,041
These are vines I use on the cliff.

698
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,961
I twirl them together to make
them longer and stronger.

699
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,930
See how strong they are?

700
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,409
You wanna see the really cool part?

701
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,329
It's inside. Come on, let's go!

702
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,961
Come on!

703
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,606
It's the honey stash for winter!

704
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,162
Have you lost your mind?

705
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,163
You said you wouldn't get mad.

706
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,563
Did you listen to anything
akela taught you?

707
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,767
There's no place...

708
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,730
In the jungle for these...

709
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,921
Tricks!

710
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,169
You want to do this,
you do this in the man village.

711
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,088
But I'm helping baloo
get ready for hibernation.

712
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,449
Bears don't hibernate in a jungle.

713
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,926
What are you teaching him?

714
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,689
Not full hibernation, but I nap a lot.

715
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,122
Listen to me, you con artist!

716
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,248
He may not know your game, but I do.

717
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,404
- He's leaving now.
- But I don't wanna leave!

718
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,450
You don't have a choice!

719
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,161
Why don't we all just
settle down for a minute.

720
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,087
Look, it's gotten late.
Too late to travel.

721
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,009
So, why don't we all
just have a little honey...

722
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,606
I don't eat honey.

723
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,928
No problem. I'll eat the honey.

724
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,770
Let's all get a good night's sleep...

725
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,450
And we can talk about this
in the morning.

726
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,284
Fine. But we're leaving, first thing.

727
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,080
Bagheerai mowgli.

728
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,006
Where is he?

729
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,284
- In the pit.
- In the what?

730
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,762
- Is this your teaching?
- Oh, come on!

731
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,764
You know I'd never teach him
to mess around with elephants.

732
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:49,766
Hey, guys.

733
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,721
What'd I tell you? He's special.

734
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,885
I know he's special.

735
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,530
I raised him.

736
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,563
Then don't make him leave, bagheera!

737
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,007
You gotta let him be what he is.

738
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,726
You don't understand.
The boy's in danger.

739
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,406
I know, he told me.
He's being hunted by a tiger.

740
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,847
<i>Not any “get. Share Khan.</i>

741
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,362
Shere Khan's hunting him?

742
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,521
Oh.

743
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,690
But if you send him back
to the man village,

744
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,927
they'll ruin him.

745
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,809
They'll make a man out of him.

746
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,530
We should send him back
to the wolf pack.

747
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,241
Who's their Alpha?
Akela, he can protect him.

748
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,243
Akela is dead.

749
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,208
- What?
- Shere Khan killed him.

750
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,570
He will stop at nothing
until he has this boy.

751
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,767
Nothing.

752
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,645
The only way we can save him...

753
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,962
Is if he goes to that man village.

754
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,565
Please, baloo.

755
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,129
You're the only one he'll listen to.

756
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,806
Hey, kid.

757
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,251
Hey.

758
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,883
That was pretty cool,
what you did back there.

759
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,884
Bagheera didn't think so.

760
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,646
Oh, no, I talked to him.
He was very impressed.

761
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,881
He was?

762
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,405
We both were. Yeah.

763
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,804
I've never seen anyone get

764
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,922
that close to an elephant before.

765
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,967
So, listen, kid.

766
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,248
I gotta talk to you about something.

767
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,925
What do you wanna talk about?

768
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,650
I've been thinking.

769
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,842
Now that your friend has shown up...

770
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,445
Maybe it's time...

771
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,331
For you two to just mosey along.

772
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,008
Now it's winter...

773
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,844
And it's really time for you to go.

774
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,808
But I wanna stay here with you.

775
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,922
We're buddies, aren't we?

776
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,131
Huh? No, we were never friends.

777
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,482
I certainly never thought
of you as my friend.

778
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,803
You helped me get honey
and I don't really need you any more...

779
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,009
Do I have to spell this out?

780
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,410
I don't want you around any more.

781
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,724
I did it.

782
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,366
And that's about the hardest thing
I've ever done.

783
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,810
I know.

784
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,767
Go away.

785
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,564
Get away from me.

786
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,449
Stop it.

787
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,650
Get away from me!

788
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,088
Bagheera!

789
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,566
Mowgli!

790
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,410
Mowgli, hold on!

791
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,045
Bagheera!

792
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,124
What was that?
Where are they taking him?

793
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,770
Bagheerai this way.

794
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,811
Mowglii ahh! Ah!

795
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,121
Whoa!

796
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,807
We see you! We see you!

797
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,247
Come on, jump!

798
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,727
And watch the claws.

799
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,522
Gah!

800
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,841
Uh...

801
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,770
I'll take it from here.

802
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,446
No, I'm coming.

803
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,331
It's doable...

804
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,727
If I don't have to go too high.

805
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,484
Good. Let's get going.

806
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,606
All right.

807
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,688
A bird. That can't be a good sign.

808
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,442
Baloo.
Look at me. Look at nothing but me.

809
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,645
- Hmm?
- You're doing fine.

810
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,131
Just keep your eyes up high.

811
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,526
All right. I'm coming. I'm coming.

812
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,880
What part of the jungle you from?

813
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,040
You, man-cub.

814
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,724
You come from the south, the north?

815
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,203
What part of the jungle?

816
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,162
The south, I guess.

817
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,490
Southern jungle, the seeonee.

818
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,246
Beautiful, I hear.
I never been there myself.

819
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,722
So, tell me, you ever had
a taste of the pawpaw fruit...

820
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,370
Down there in the seeonee?

821
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,808
Some people call it the...
What's the word?

822
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,487
Papaya. Stolen words.

823
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,290
I say pawpaw.

824
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,364
Goes to the sound it makes
when it tumbles to the jungle floor.

825
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,161
Try it.

826
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,046
Go ahead.

827
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,491
It's good.

828
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,165
You know who I am?

829
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,401
No.

830
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,009
I am the king of the bandar-log.

831
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,606
Call me Louie.

832
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,966
I did it!

833
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,530
Well done, old chap.

834
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,886
He must be in there.
Follow me.

835
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,690
No, no.
We're on level ground here.

836
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,524
I'm in charge.

837
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,284
And I've got a plan.

838
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,885
You are a man-cub
who wants to live in the jungle.

839
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,010
How do you know that?

840
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,481
Kid...

841
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,247
I got ears. My ears got ears.

842
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,084
You wanna live here?

843
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,641
You need a people to protect you.

844
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,802
Only I can protect you...

845
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,650
And I will, for a price.

846
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,329
I don't have anything to give you.

847
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,210
I think you do.

848
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,041
What?

849
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,448
Look around, man-cub.

850
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,130
I got everything.

851
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,044
I have plentiful food...

852
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,406
Endless treasure...

853
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,841
Command vast legions.

854
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,763
But there's one thing I don't have...

855
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,531
And that's the one thing...

856
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,046
You can give me.

857
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,569
The red flower.

858
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,688
I don't have that!

859
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,049
You're a man, aren't you?

860
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,486
That's what makes you a man.

861
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,007
You can summon the red flower...

862
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,969
And control it.

863
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,641
They told me not to go near
the red flower.

864
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,885
You know why they tell you that?

865
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,522
Because once you have it,
you rise to the top of the food chain.

866
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,530
Nothing in this jungle can stand up...

867
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,250
To the red flower.

868
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,885
Please, I just wanna go.

869
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,800
<i>Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub</i>

870
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,962
<i>I'll make a deal with you</i>

871
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,044
<i>what I desire is man's red fire</i>

872
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,844
<i>to make my dream come true</i>

873
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,844
<i>now give me the secret, man-cub</i>

874
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,691
<i>come on!
Clue me what to do</i>

875
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,924
<i>give me the power
of man's red flower</i>

876
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,923
<i>so I can be like you</i>

877
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,805
<i>oh, ooo-be do</i>

878
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,601
<i>I wanna be like you-oo-oo</i>

879
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,885
<i>I wanna walk like you,
talk like you too-oo-oo</i>

880
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:31,001
<i>you'll see it's true-oo-oo,
someone like me-ee-ee</i>

881
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,969
<i>can learn to be
like someone like you-oo-oo</i>

882
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,126
<i>now you might think
it's ridiculous that me</i>

883
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,041
<i>a gigantopithecus,
would ever dream</i>

884
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:45,289
<i>I'd like to team with
the likes of you, man-cub</i>

885
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,489
<i>but together we'd have powers</i>

886
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,246
<i>all the jungle's treasures, ours</i>

887
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,762
<i>I got desire, you got the fire</i>

888
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,445
<i>but the dream I dream takes two</i>

889
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,609
so, 00-00-00

890
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,929
I wanna <i>be like</i> you-oo-oo

891
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,971
<i>I wanna use that flame</i>

892
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,602
<i>just the same as you can do</i>

893
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,361
<i>oh, how magnificus it would be</i>

894
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,120
<i>a gigantopithecus like me</i>

895
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,401
<i>could learn to do</i>

896
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,808
<i>like you humans do-oo-oo</i>

897
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,445
just one thing we need...

898
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,728
To reach our full potential.

899
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,087
Bring me that red flower...

900
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,050
And we will rule this jungle.

901
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,690
I will protect you.

902
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,807
And you will want for nothing,
ever again.

903
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,926
I can't!

904
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,050
You can't or you won't?

905
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,925
I can't!

906
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,327
You will!

907
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,011
Excuse me!

908
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,161
Anybody?

909
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:41,961
Excuse me...

910
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,209
Am I in the right monkey temple?

911
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,211
Oh, my gosh.

912
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,364
Is that king Louie?

913
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,888
This is so exciting.

914
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,886
The legends do you no justice, sir.

915
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,682
You are truly enormous.

916
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,804
In the best way.

917
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,770
Look at all of that flesh...

918
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,763
Just squatting there...

919
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,410
On an ancient throne.

920
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,686
How majestic.

921
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,806
Seize him.

922
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,410
Hey, hang on.

923
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,164
Can you just hang on?

924
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,210
I climbed a mountain to see you,
and I'm not a climber.

925
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,362
Just to be in your presence.

926
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,285
For me, this is a dream come true. Oh...

927
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,531
Throw him off the cliff.

928
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,123
Wait, wait, wait.

929
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,725
I have no problem with that.

930
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,370
I don't have any problem with that.

931
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,091
I came up here without an invitation.

932
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,049
It was extremely presumptuous of me.

933
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,527
Let me interrupt myself.

934
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,601
I just gotta say...

935
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,564
You guys are so much handsomer
in person than anyone knows.

936
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,802
No one ever gets up close to you.

937
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:46,961
Why?

938
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,531
Because of the smell.

939
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,489
The smell is rough.

940
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,201
But it's not just, "oh, look at me."

941
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,284
It's, "i got the brains."
You guys got the know-how.

942
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,404
You got the noggin.

943
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,006
You came up with this stuff,
with the thumb.

944
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,731
Come on, show me.
How do you do that? I can't do that.

945
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,050
Look, I scratch, I rub, I can grab a fish.

946
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,881
But I was hoping, and you may
not be open to this at all...

947
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,247
But I was hoping,
and once again, it's a dream...

948
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,127
But I was hoping that I might become...

949
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,169
A bandar-log myself.

950
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,245
Gosh, I wanna be like you.

951
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,444
I am hitching my wagon to your star.

952
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,721
No one leaves!

953
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,282
I can show myself out. Thanks. Bye-bye!

954
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,968
We'll try to hold them off.

955
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,004
Where you going, man-cub?

956
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,004
Stay away from me!

957
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,522
You don't have anyone now.

958
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:33,923
I'm your only hope.
I can make it real good for you here.

959
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,491
Where else you gonna go?

960
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,325
I'll go back to the pack!

961
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,171
I'll go back to akela!

962
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,046
Akela?

963
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,611
Oh.

964
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:43,966
You didn't hear?

965
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,842
Shere Khan killed him.

966
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,367
Must've been on account of you.

967
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,610
No! You're lying!

968
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,803
Don't run away...

969
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,041
From who you are!
You hear me?

970
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,042
Think about it, man-cub.

971
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,841
We can rule this jungle.

972
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,681
No...

973
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,046
Listen to reason.

974
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,646
Gotcha!

975
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,046
Mowgli!

976
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,609
If anything happens to that kid...

977
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,525
I'll never forgive myself.

978
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,447
- Bagheera!
- Mowgli?

979
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,761
Stay there.

980
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,924
We'll come around to you.

981
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,205
Is it true?

982
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,761
What?

983
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,322
Is akela dead?

984
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,005
We were going to tell you.

985
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,486
You knew!

986
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,165
You both knew!

987
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,887
And nobody did anything about it!

988
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,371
Kid, just hold on.

989
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,207
Someone's gotta do something!

990
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,324
Wlowgn!

991
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,891
There's no trace of him.

992
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,565
Where could he have gone?

993
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,641
Come on!

994
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,886
It's man.

995
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,371
He's come to the jungle.

996
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,924
Ami, what's happening?

997
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,091
The red flower.

998
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,402
Everybody, get to the river!

999
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,568
Red flower.

1000
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,562
Pups, come on. Stay close.

1001
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,127
Ls that mowgli?

1002
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,805
Shere Khan!

1003
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,720
Shere Khan!

1004
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,245
I'm not afraid of you!

1005
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,681
No one has to be afraid of you any more!

1006
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,327
No...

1007
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,202
I think they're afraid
of something else now.

1008
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,281
The man-cub is now a man.

1009
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,521
Gray...

1010
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,204
Always a proud day...

1011
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,804
When they come of age.

1012
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:38,640
You can fool them, but you can't fool me.

1013
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,330
I'm the one who saw your future.

1014
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,526
I saw what you'd become.

1015
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,805
Come now, use the red flower.

1016
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,486
Use it on me like your father did.

1017
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,206
Show everyone what you really are!

1018
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,362
I'm mowgli of the seeonee
and this is my home!

1019
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,683
That was the stupidest thing
you could've done.

1020
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,163
Now you have nothing.

1021
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,687
No claws, no fur, no teeth...

1022
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,722
And no friends.

1023
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,526
"This is the law of the jungle...

1024
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,041
"As old and as true as the sky."

1025
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,247
What is this?

1026
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,563
"The wolf that keeps it may prosper...

1027
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,929
"But the wolf
that breaks it will die."

1028
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,281
You fools.

1029
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,410
"Like the creeper
that girdles the tree trunk...

1030
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,086
"The law runneth over and back."

1031
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,050
Fine! Rise up, all of you!

1032
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,847
You want to put yourselves
between me and the man-cub?

1033
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,011
"...and the strength
of the wolf is the pack."

1034
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,050
I will have you all
in my teeth!

1035
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,044
- No!
- Wolves, attack!

1036
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,243
Stay here!

1037
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,171
But I wanna fight with the wolves!

1038
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,887
- You can't fight him like a wolf.
- You're not a wolf!

1039
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,843
Fight him like a man.

1040
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:43,921
Now, go!

1041
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,887
Okay.

1042
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,001
We'll hold him off.

1043
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,410
It's time
we put an end to this.

1044
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:39,561
Rakshai no!

1045
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,171
Dead tree.

1046
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,890
It's just you and me now!

1047
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,244
Break, break!

1048
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,963
You've got nowhere to go, man-cub!

1049
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,529
Did you think I would let you grow old?

1050
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,886
Either I'll devour you
or the red flower will.

1051
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,010
It's just a matter of time.

1052
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:03,168
How long did you really think
you'd survive against me?

1053
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:07,044
Longer than your father did?

1054
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:12,203
Longer than... akela?

1055
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,611
I'm not afraid of you!

1056
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,645
Do you hear me?

1057
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,328
I'm done running from you!

1058
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,442
You stood your ground, old boy.

1059
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,284
You stood your ground.

1060
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,845
<i>Ami, ami!</i>

1061
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,004
My son.

1062
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,169
Mowgli!
- Lt's mowgli!

1063
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,090
Mowgli.

1064
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,444
Will you look at that?

1065
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,928
<i>And where they made
furrows in the ground with their tusks...</i>

1066
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,526
<i>There the rivers ran.</i>

1067
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,331
<i>In my years, I've seen
a lot in this jungle.</i>

1068
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,601
<i>But that night...</i>

1069
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,366
<i>I saw something I'll never forget.</i>

1070
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,724
<i>I saw a little boy...</i>

1071
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,243
<i>Without a people...</i>

1072
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:20,130
<i>Bring all the jungle together
for the very first time.</i>

1073
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,325
Just a few more turns.

1074
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,121
"M going high!

1075
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,366
Stay low.

1076
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,605
He never listens.

1077
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,281
Gotcha!

1078
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,522
- Come on, mowgli.
- You went in the tree.

1079
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,601
- That wasn't fair.
- We almost made it.

1080
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:05,961
You guys...

1081
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,440
Are going too fast.

1082
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,001
Anybody ever teach you how to jog?

1083
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,131
You went high when everyone else
stayed on the trail.

1084
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,767
- But that's what you do.
- Maybe, but I'm not a wolf.

1085
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,928
- Next time, stay together.
- Come on, guys.

1086
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,771
"For the strength of the pack is the..."

1087
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,521
- Wolf.
-"Wolf...

1088
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:29,724
"And the strength of the wolf
is the pack."

1089
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,291
Mowgli's back!

1090
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,207
Hey, mowgli! Wait for us.

1091
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:39,167
Hurry up, guys.

1092
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,447
Hi, gray.

1093
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,166
Look well, wolves.

1094
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,240
"This is the law of the jungle...

1095

1101
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,200
This is nice up here.

1102
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:20,248
Now he can climb.

1103
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:26,403
Please don't tell me
you're about to head down.

1104
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:37,122
I could get used to this.

1105
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,648
<i>Now I'm the king of the swingers</i>

1106

<i>oh, the jungle vip</i>

1107
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,731
<i>I've reached the top and had to stop</i>

1108
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,723
<i>and that's what's botherin' me</i>

1109
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,962
<i>I wanna be a man, man-cub</i>

1110
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,209
<i>and stroll right into town</i>

1111

1117

1119
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,604
<i>I'll make a deal with you</i>

1120
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,406
<i>what I desire is man's red fire</i>

1121
